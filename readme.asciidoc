== Linux <3

=== 1. Open Source Nature
* What is it like when you buy a car, but you cannot see what’s under the hood? Similar is the case with when you use a Windows-powered system.

* However, in contrast, Linux is completely an open source project. You can have a look at the source code of a Linux OS, which is a plus.

* I know, most people don’t care about this openness of Linux, but to me, this is the most important feature of using GNU/Linux.

== 2. Secure
. Let’s face it; Windows OS is vulnerable to different types of attacks (or hacks). However, Linux is not as vulnerable as Windows. It sure isn’t invulnerable, but it is a lot more secure. Although, there’s no rocket science in it.

. It is just the way Linux works that makes it a secure operating system. Overall, the process of package management, the concept of repositories, and a couple more features makes it possible for Linux to be more secure than Windows.

. When you have Windows installed, you need to download/purchase an Antivirus program to keep your computer safe from hackers and malware. However, Linux does not require the use of such Anti-Virus programs. Of course, a couple of software tools still exist to help you keep your system free from threats, but it is often unnecessary when you have a Linux system.

. Being secure by nature would make things easier for you and save money as well because you will not have to get a premium Antivirus software!

== 3. Can revive older computers
 
IMPORTANT: As the operating systems evolve, so do their hardware requirements increase exponentially. 

TIP: Nevertheless, with Linux, you could even utilize one of your oldest computer systems to achieve a task. 

NOTE: So, being an efficient OS, Linux distributions could be fitted to a range of systems (low-end or high-end).

[[bookmark-a]]Overall, even if you compare a high-end Linux system and a high-end Windows-powered system, the Linux distribution would take the edge.

[#bookmark-b]#Well,that is the reason most of the servers across the world prefer to run on Linux than on a Windows hosting environment.#

anchor:bookmark-c[]Linux supports almost all of the major programming languages (Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, Ruby, etc.). Moreover, it offers a vast range of applications useful for programming purposes.

The Linux terminal is superior to use over Window’s command line for developers. You would find many libraries developed natively for Linux. Also, a lot of programmers point out that the package manager on Linux helps them get things done easily. <<c>>

Interestingly, the ability of bash scripting is also one of the most compelling reasons why programmers prefer using Linux OS.

Worked out MSHR (max sustainable heart rate) by going hard
for this interval.

|22-Aug-08 |23:03 | 152 |
Back-to-back with previous interval.

|24-Aug-08 |40:00 | 145 |
Moderately hard interspersed with 3x 3min intervals (2min
hard + 1min really hard taking the HR up to 160).
